# Bookmarks Social Website Project üìù  
We are going to create a social application that will allow users to share images that they find on the internet.

We will implement social features to let users share images and interact with each other.

Users will be able to bookmark any image on the internet and share it with other users.

They will also be able to see activity on the platform from the users they follow and like/unlike the images shared by them.

## Features üöÄ  
- An **authentication** system for users to register, log in, edit their profile, and change or reset their password.
- A **follow** system to allow users to follow each other on the website.
- Functionality to display shared images and a system for users to share images from any website.
- An **activity stream** that allows users to see the content uploaded by the people that they follow.
